## About
This project is a public good to help developers and learning communities onboard testing users to prototypes and pre-productions apps. POAPcet requires users to hold a POAP defined by devs or event organizers in order to deliver a small amount of testnet currencies for gas fees.    

## How it's made

We will build a custom faucet working on a vite app that fetches POAs held by users through POAP API  to enable test funds distribution and attest onboarding users with the Attestation contract on Optimism.
